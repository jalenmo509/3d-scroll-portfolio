      <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Jalen Moses, and I'm a passionate individual with a love for comics, photography, and sports. But
        above all, my true passion lies in technology. With expertise in multiple programming languages such as
        JavaScript, Python, and Java, I'm equipped with the skills necessary to build web applications from scratch and
        integrate them with existing systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a self-motivated learner, I'm constantly staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends
        to ensure that I can deliver innovative software solutions to businesses and individuals in the tech industry.
        Recently, I completed a 14-week intensive coding bootcamp, which allowed me to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        three full stacks in Python/Flask/MySQL, JAVA, and MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and spent over 1000
        hours honing my craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm excited to leverage my unique combination of skills and experience to make meaningful contributions to the
        tech community. I'm determined to work hard, learn more, and make a real difference in the world of technology.
        My passion and drive will help me to continue growing and making a positive impact in the industry.
      </p>
